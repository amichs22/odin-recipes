        <h2 class="description2">Description</h2>
        <p>Today I am so excited to show you how to make the best Cheesecake Recipe of your life. Simple, classic, and no water bath required!! The texture is smooth, rich, and creamy, served over a crisp homemade graham cracker crust.</p>
        <p>This cheesecake recipe has been a long time coming. For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla & salt), it took a lot longer than you might think to develop the perfect version. I have shared a few cheesecake variations in the past, including my No-Bake Cheesecake, but getting a perfected classic version took lots of testing. Finally, here we are.</p>
        <p>Oh, and we are skipping the water bath! I have always found them to be largely unnecessary with cheesecakes. Cook yours on a low temperature and follow my tips below and you will have a perfectly creamy and crack-less cheesecake without all the hassle of a water bath.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Graham Cracker crust
                   <ul>
                       <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
                       <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                       <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
                       <li>7 tablespoons melted butter</li>
                   </ul>
               </li> 
               <li>Cheesecake
                   <ul>
                       <li>32 oz cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
                       <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                       <li>2/3 cups sour cream</li>
                       <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                       <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                       <li>4 large eggs room temperature, lightly beaten</li>   
                   </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C).</li>
                <li>Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring well. Add melted butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well.</li>
                <li>Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of your pan. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (do not over-beat or you will incorporate too much air).</li>
                <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
                <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated</li>
                <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
                <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that has been lined with foil.</li>
                <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).</li>
                <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. Enjoy!</li>
