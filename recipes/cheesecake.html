        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Today I am so excited to show you how to make the best Cheesecake Recipe of your life. Simple, classic, and no water bath required!! The texture is smooth, rich, and creamy, served over a crisp homemade graham cracker crust.</p>
        <p>This cheesecake recipe has been a long time coming. For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla & salt), it took a lot longer than you might think to develop the perfect version. I have shared a few cheesecake variations in the past, including my No-Bake Cheesecake, but getting a perfected classic version took lots of testing. Finally, here we are.</p>
        <p>Oh, and we are skipping the water bath! I have always found them to be largely unnecessary with cheesecakes. Cook yours on a low temperature and follow my tips below and you will have a perfectly creamy and crack-less cheesecake without all the hassle of a water bath.</p>
