# odin-recipes
First Odin Project

Describe what current project is:

    In this project I will be be building a basic recipe website. 

What skills I will have demonstrated once I have finished this project:

    Once I finish this project, I will have demonstrated all the skills that I have learned so far thru Project Odin's HTML course. I will also be showing my ability to use git and GitHub in an effective manner.  

Self reflection at the end of the project/what have I learned:
    This project did not take me as long as I thought it would take me. I was quite nervous when I first started because I didn't think that I could remember all the information that I had learned in the previous sections that came before this project. That feeling went away when I started the acutal project. I found that I was able to follow along with the instructions quite well, and that I did not have to go back and re-reference any notes! I was able to confidently finish the project, and I think that I did a great job!

    I will say that the one thing that I had some trouble with in the beginning was trying to understand what I was supposed to be doing with git and GitHub. I wasn't really sure when I was supposed to be using commit or staging my work. I tried to work with the the concept of atomic commits in mind. This basically meant that whenever I would finish a small but significant section of code in my project, I would choose that time to stage and commit. I think I had the right idea with that, and when I went to look at GitHub after I was done, it was quite easy to follow along with the steps of my project. 

    Overall, I think this project went very well! I think that this really gave me a confidence boost regarding my html skills as I was able to finish this project with no issues at all!
